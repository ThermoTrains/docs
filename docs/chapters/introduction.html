    <h3>Current Situation</h3>

    <p>
        WorldSkills International is a non-profit membership association which organizes a world championship in skilled
        professions every two years. The author of this thesis is employed by WorldSkills International. To manage
        members
        and to organize the preparation and execution of the competition the organization runs multiple web
        applications.
        The mix of PHP and Java applications consists of legacy systems and a newly developed software system with a
        service-oriented architecture.
    </p>

    <p>
        All web software is running on rented virtual servers with a Linux operating system. They are managed manually
        using
        a web control panel (<a href="#ref-plesk">Parallels Plesk</a>). Changes to the infrastructure are done by the
        four
        internal software developers manually.
    </p>

    <p>
        Fundamental changes like the migration to a new server or the switch to a new runtime engine require a lot of
        knowledge about the existing system and manual testing of the new installation.
    </p>

    <h3>Objectives</h3>

    <p>
        The main goal of this thesis is to develop a concept for a versioned, testable and reproducible infrastructure.
        Changes to the system should be visible for the IT team and traceable if needed. As a result knowledge is shared
        in
        written form.
    </p>

    <p class="break">
        To achieve this goal, manual steps to build or change the infrastructure should be replaced by code stored in a
        revision control system. Three different types of software for provisioning of servers and deployment exist at
        the
        moment:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Software containers: Software needed to run an application is encapsulated and run in operating system-level
            virtualization. Examples are <a href="#ref-docker">Docker</a>, <a href="#ref-rkt">rkt</a>.
        </li>
        <li>Configuration repository: A centralized repository with configuration files and software is used to
            configure
            servers. Examples are <a href="#ref-chef">Chef</a>, <a href="#ref-puppet">Puppet</a>, <a
                    href="#ref-cfengine">CFEngine</a>.
        </li>
        <li>Remote command execution: Installation commands and configuration files are transmitted in a coordinated
            manner
            to a remote server. Examples are <a href="#ref-ansible">Ansible</a>, <a href="#ref-saltstack">SaltStack</a>,
            <a href="#ref-rex">Rex</a>.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        These types of software should be evaluated and an architecture documentation as well as a test concept should
        be
        written.
        The proposed architecture should then be tested in a proof-of-concept.
    </p>

    <h3>Tasks</h3>

    <p>
        The following tasks will be completed by the student as part of the bachelor thesis:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>Analyze infrastructure requirements</li>
        <li>Test requirements with popular representatives for each type of provisioning software</li>
        <li>Evaluate provisioning software</li>
        <li>Write architecture documentation</li>
        <li>Develop test concept</li>
        <li>Implement proof-of-concept with automated provisioning and deployment</li>
    </ol>

        the most important milestones.
