<p>
    WorldSkills International manages its web infrastructure manually with a small team of developers. There is no
    designated system administrator, the responsibility of managing the web infrastructure is shared among the
    developers. The author of this thesis is employed as a developer by WorldSkills International. Target of the thesis
    is to develop a concept for a testable and reproducible infrastructure where all changes are done within a revision
    control system. This increases visibility of changes within the developers team and makes the change tracable.

    Many software solutions exist for provisioning of servers and deployment of applications. They can be grouped into
    software containers, configuration repository, and remote command execution. With software containers the software
    needed to run an application is encapsulated and run in operating system-level virtualization. A configuration
    repository is a centralized repository with configuration files and software is used to configure servers based on
    the configuration files. With remote command execution the installation commands and configuration files are
    transmitted in a coordinated manner to a remote server.

    The current infrastructure requirements were analyzed and documented. The different types of software for
    provisioning of servers and deployment of applications were considered for solving the problem. Each type was
    evaluated with a popular representative according to the requirements. The evaluation showed that software
    containers need additional software for the orchestration of the provisioning and deployment. Due to the additional
    complexity and the missing requirements for software containers their usage was delayed to a potential separate
    project after this thesis. The automation software Ansible was choosen as best fitting for the requirements.

<p>
    An architecture concept for an automated infrastructure was developed and successfully verified in a
    proof-of-concept. All software and configuration files required are defined in structured text files that can be
    read and transmitted to the server with Ansible. Local development and testing can be done in a virtual machine on
    the developersâ€™ computer. The whole infrastructure can easily be cloned by running the provisioning scripts against
    new servers. A continious integration server executes the provisioning script after each change and verifies the
    infrastructure with system tests. The automated creation of the proof-of-concept infrastructure takes about 20
    minutes. The automated process of setting up a new infrastructure environment for testing is simply initiated by
    creating a new branch adhering to a naming scheme. The implementation of the architecture concept and a migration to
    the new automated infrastructure is planned for fall 2015.
