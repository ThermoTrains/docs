        <p>
            WorldSkills International manages its web infrastructure manually with a small team of developers. There is no designated
            system administrator, the responsibility of managing the web infrastructure is shared among the developers. The
            author of this thesis is employed as a developer by WorldSkills International. Target of the thesis is to develop
            a concept for a testable and reproducible infrastructure where all changes are done within a revision control
            system. This increases visibility of changes within the developers team and makes the change tracable.
        </p>

        <p>
            Many software solutions exist for provisioning of servers and deployment of applications. They can be grouped into software
            containers, configuration repository, and remote command execution. With software containers the software needed
            to run an application is encapsulated and run in operating system-level virtualization. A configuration repository
            is a centralized repository with configuration files and software is used to configure servers based on the configuration
            files. With remote command execution the installation commands and configuration files are transmitted in a coordinated
            manner to a remote server.
        </p>

        <p>
            The current infrastructure requirements were analyzed and documented. The different types of software for provisioning of
            servers and deployment of applications were considered for solving the problem. Each type was evaluated with
            a popular representative according to the requirements. The evaluation showed that software containers need additional
            software for the orchestration of the provisioning and deployment. Due to the additional complexity and the missing
            requirements for software containers their usage was delayed to a potential separate project after this thesis.
            The automation software Ansible was choosen as best fitting for the requirements.
        </p>

        <p>
            An architecture concept for an automated infrastructure was developed and successfully verified in a proof-of-concept. All
            software and configuration files required are defined in structured text files that can be read and transmitted
            to the server with Ansible. Local development and testing can be done in a virtual machine on the developers’
            computer. The whole infrastructure can easily be cloned by running the provisioning scripts against new servers.
            A continious integration server executes the provisioning script after each change and verifies the infrastructure
            with system tests. The automated creation of the proof-of-concept infrastructure takes about 20 minutes. The
            automated process of setting up a new infrastructure environment for testing is simply initiated by creating
            a new branch adhering to a naming scheme. The implementation of the architecture concept and a migration to the
            new automated infrastructure is planned for fall 2015.

        <h2 class="break">Introduction</h2>

        <h3>Current Situation</h3>

        <p>
            WorldSkills International is a non-profit membership association which organizes a world championship in skilled professions
            every two years. The author of this thesis is employed by WorldSkills International. To manage members and to
            organize the preparation and execution of the competition the organization runs multiple web applications. The
            mix of PHP and Java applications consists of legacy systems and a newly developed software system with a service-oriented
            architecture.
        </p>

        <p>
            All web software is running on rented virtual servers with a Linux operating system. They are managed manually using a web
            control panel (<a href="#ref-plesk">Parallels Plesk</a>). Changes to the infrastructure are done
            by the four internal software developers manually.
        </p>

        <p>
            Fundamental changes like the migration to a new server or the switch to a new runtime engine require a lot of knowledge about
            the existing system and manual testing of the new installation.
        </p>

        <h3>Objectives</h3>

        <p>
            The main goal of this thesis is to develop a concept for a versioned, testable and reproducible infrastructure. Changes to
            the system should be visible for the IT team and traceable if needed. As a result knowledge is shared in written
            form.
        </p>

        <p class="break">
            To achieve this goal, manual steps to build or change the infrastructure should be replaced by code stored in a revision
            control system. Three different types of software for provisioning of servers and deployment exist at the moment:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Software containers: Software needed to run an application is encapsulated and run in operating system-level
                virtualization. Examples are <a href="#ref-docker">Docker</a>, <a href="#ref-rkt">rkt</a>.</li>
            <li>Configuration repository: A centralized repository with configuration files and software is used to configure
                servers. Examples are <a href="#ref-chef">Chef</a>, <a href="#ref-puppet">Puppet</a>, <a href="#ref-cfengine">CFEngine</a>.</li>
            <li>Remote command execution: Installation commands and configuration files are transmitted in a coordinated manner
                to a remote server. Examples are <a href="#ref-ansible">Ansible</a>, <a href="#ref-saltstack">SaltStack</a>,
                <a href="#ref-rex">Rex</a>.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            These types of software should be evaluated and an architecture documentation as well as a test concept should be written.
            The proposed architecture should then be tested in a proof-of-concept.
        </p>

        <h3>Tasks</h3>

        <p>
            The following tasks will be completed by the student as part of the bachelor thesis:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>Analyze infrastructure requirements</li>
            <li>Test requirements with popular representatives for each type of provisioning software</li>
            <li>Evaluate provisioning software</li>
            <li>Write architecture documentation</li>
            <li>Develop test concept</li>
            <li>Implement proof-of-concept with automated provisioning and deployment</li>
        </ol>

        <h3 class="break">Project Management</h3>

        <p>
            The following gantt diagram shows an overview of the actual timeline during the project as well as the dates of the most
            important milestones.
